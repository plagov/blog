== Info
The source code of my blog which is hosted on https://plagov.github.io

== Run locally
While writing a new blog post and running the hugo locally, open the root of the project and run command to run local
Hugo server:

[source,shell script]
hugo server -D

== Deploy
After finishing writing the text of the post, build the page from source by running command:

[source,shell script]
hugo

That will build HTML files in `./public` directory. Then, commit and push everything either by running the shell
script:

[source,shell script]
bash ./deploy.sh

Or open the `./public` directory manually, stage, commit and push changes to the origin:

[source,shell script]
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push -u origin main

That will push the rendered version of the blog to GitHub Pages hosting.

To commit changes in source code, go to the root of the `blog` repository and commit everything as usual.
